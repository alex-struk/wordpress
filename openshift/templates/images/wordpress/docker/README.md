This docker build is from https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/ and is preserved here:
* So customizations can be made for our platform, if need be, and then preserved. 

This implementation is built on top of the php-fpm image, and adds the WordPress bits needed for WordPress to work, built in the WordPress way.
* Use it as a WordPress runtime container that serves from a persistent volume.
